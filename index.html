<p>
O
</p>
<p>
fury-
</p>
<p>
bedecked!
</p>
<p>
O glitter-torn!
</p>
<p>
Let the wild wind erect
bonbonbonanzas;  &nbsp;junipers affect
frostyfreeze turbans;  &nbsp; &nbsp;iciclestuff adorn
all cuckolded creation in a madcap crown of horn!
</p>
It’s a new day; no scapegrace of a sect
tidying up the ashtrays playing Daughter-in-Law Elect;
bells! bibelots! popsicle cigars! shatter the glassware! a son born
 &nbsp;now &nbsp;
now
<p>
while ox and ass and infant lie
together as poor creatures will
</p>
and tears of her exertion still
cling in the spent girl’s eye
<br>
and a great 
</br>firework in the sky
drifts to the western hill.
